# Weather Dashboard
  Created by Bethany Proctor 

  ## Description
  This is a simple weather app that allows you to search for a city and see the current and future forecast. The app allows you to see the temperature, wind speed, humidity, and current weather conditions of your chosen location. This was a great exercise in learning the basics of fetching API data and JavaScript, especially in regards to manipulating the DOM.
